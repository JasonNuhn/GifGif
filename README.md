GifGif
====
GifGif is a React based Giphy client that allows you to both view gifs from Giphy as well as create your own using Yahoo's Gifshot library 
(https://github.com/yahoo/gifshot) 

This project was originally an imgur client based off of Stephen Griders awesome React tutorial.

###Getting Started###

Before running starting up the project you'll have to remove the 'giphy_key' require statement from 'server/controller/gifs.js' and use the giphy public API key(dc6zaTOxFJmzC) in its place.

```
	> git clone git@github.com:StephenGrider/ReactStarter.git
	> cd ReactStarter
	> npm install
	> gulp
```
